## About

*This project is based on code for the [Udacity Memory Project](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) for the front-end web design course. This fork is my version of the game done for the class.* 

This project is a simple memory matching game. Flip over two cards by clicking on them, if the two cards match they will stay, if they do not match, they will flip back over. Try to flip over all the cards to win. If you win in less than 20 turns you will get 3 stars, more that 20 but less than 30 for two stars, and over 30 is one star. A timer will start when you click on the first card and stop when you match all the cards.
