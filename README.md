## About

This project is based on code for the [Udacity Memory Project](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) for the front-end web design course. This fork is my version of the game done for the class.

## Contributing

I used [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to make this project work on older browsers so make sure to run `npm install` to download the dependancies. Then run `npm run build` to run babel. To make changes to the code open the `js/app.js` file. It will automatically run everytime you save. If you do not want to use babel you can either change the html to use the `js/app.js` file or edit the js-es5/app.js file. Also any javascript file in the `js/` directory will be transpilled to the js-es5 directory.
