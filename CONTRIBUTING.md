# How to contribute

I used [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to make this project work on older browsers so make sure to run `npm install` to download the dependancies. Then run `npm run build` to run babel. To make changes to the code open the `js/app.js` file. It will automatically run everytime you save. If you do not want to use babel you can either change the html to use the `js/app.js` file or edit the js-es5/app.js file. Also any javascript file in the `js/` directory will be transpilled to the js-es5 directory.
